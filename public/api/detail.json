GX. Well, at least it was, until there were six different Yu-Gi-Oh! anime to choose from, and the conversation became much more complicated.</p><p>Nevertheless, when pitting Yu-Gi-Oh! -- aka Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters, to differentiate it from the 1998 Toei anime -- against Yu-Gi-Oh! GX was the cool thing to do, many fans were steadfast in their belief the spinoff was no match for its predecessor. And to this very day, many old-school Yu-Gi-Oh! devotees still hold up the original adventures of Yugi Muto and his friends as the franchise's gold standard. However, now that we have the power of hindsight, there's an argument to be made that GX is actually the stronger of the first two shows.</p>"
